# OneView Product Specification

**Product Name:** OneView (part of ONE01)

## Core Idea

OneView is a living interface for human intent over time.

It does not store posts, feeds, or dashboards.
It organizes moments of intent into navigable spheres.

## User Experience

- A clean screen
- One center
- Spheres around it (Apple Watch style)
- Drag, tap, enter
- No menus
- No clutter
- No history wall

Everything feels alive and in motion.

## Private vs Global

### PRIVATE
- Your personal AI
- Fed only by what you say, do, confirm
- Builds your internal world
- Nothing is public by default
- Empty at first

### GLOBAL
- Collective AI
- Fed only by aggregated, anonymized summaries
- Shows what is happening in the world NOW
- No raw personal data
- No profiles, no followers

## The One Unit (Final)

**Unit ≠ word**  
**Unit ≠ token**  
**Unit ≠ XP**  

**Unit = Moment of Intent**

### Definition
A Unit is created when:
- A human expresses intent
- In a specific time
- In a specific context
- With or without action

### Properties
- Countable
- Comparable
- Accumulative
- Decaying over time

## Spheres

**Sphere = Domain of intent**

### Examples
- Health
- Money
- Career
- Relationships
- Learning

### Rules
- Spheres contain spheres
- Spheres contain cards
- Cards never contain spheres

## Cards

**Card = Action or request**

### Examples
- "Lose weight"
- "Build presentation"
- "Track expenses"
- "Prepare landing page"

### States
Cards can:
- Be completed
- Be paused
- Be abandoned

**Only cards generate Units.**

## Time (The Hidden Axis)

Time is always present.
Never shown as a calendar by default.

### User Actions
- Scrub time
- Zoom in / out
- See summaries by day, week, month

### Principle
Nothing is permanent.
Everything fades unless reinforced.

## AI Role (Strict)

### AI does NOT:
- Decide goals
- Judge
- Push tasks

### AI DOES:
- Reflect
- Suggest
- Summarize
- Connect dots

**AI is a mirror, not a boss.**

## UI Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- One center at all times
- Equal-size spheres by default
- Size changes ONLY by focus
- No infinite scroll
- No feeds
- No notifications spam

## Navigation (One Rule)

**Tap center → go deeper**  
**Tap bottom breadcrumb → go back**

That's it.

## Monetization (Clean)

  - More active cards

**No ads. No selling attention.**

## What This Is NOT

moment by moment.
